This program runs carbon dating (how cool!)
The ratio of normal carbon (carbon-12) to carbon-14 in the air
and in all living things at any given time is nearly constant.
Maybe one in a trillion carbon atoms are carbon-14. Carbon-12 is
stable, but Carbon-14 decays with a half-life of approximately
5,730 years. After the organism dies it stops taking in new carbon.
